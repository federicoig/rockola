You will need a discord bot to get the token. <br /> 

Create a "config" folder and create the file "config.json" then, inside that file, copy your bot token into an object in config.json

<pre><code> { 
  token:"YOUR-TOKEN"
}
</code></pre>

## `npm install ðŸ’¾`
Install all the dependencies <br />
for the bot to work properly

## `npm start â–¶`
Host the bot in your PC

# Disclaimer
The bot doesn't work for multiple servers yet <br />
it's a feature I'll make in the future.

When the bot is ON, it will show you on Discord <br />
the command to see the rest of commands.
